This repository contains the documentation of the empirical analyses performed for the project 'Invisible data, invisible impact? â€“ Data clauses in trade agreements and their effect on international trade'. 

Abstract
This study aims at providing a foundational analysis to better understand the potential adverse effects of data-related provisions in regional trade agreements. Since 2010, more than 142 such trade agreements have been signed, with limited and mixed empirical evidence on their impact as they may exert both trade creating as well as diverting effects.  A classic structural gravity model is applied to two panel datasets of 38 OECD member states and 15 Asian economies. The results show that for OECD member states the data-related clauses lead to weak, yet significant trade diverting effects of curbing international trade by 6\% after controlling for endogeneity, reverse causality and phasing in effects. When extending the analysis to OECD member states and Asian economies, the effect of the data-related clauses in RTAs disappears. The results suggest potential for more disaggregated analysis in terms of regions, sectors and types of trade.

The repository contains:
- data.zip - the final databases used (one only for OECD eocnomies, and a second for OECD and 15 selected Asian economies)
- data_preprocessing: All python files documenting the processing of the data retrieved from USITC, the TAPED dataset as well as the data on international trade provided by Prof. Farid Toubal.
- do_files: The final do files used to set up the structural gravity model and all specifications (OECD, and OECD + Asian economies).
- results: the csv files containing the results for the model specifications (OECD, and OECD + Asian economies)
